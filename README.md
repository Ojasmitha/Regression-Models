# Comprehensive Regression Model Analysis with Scikit-Learn

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation and evaluation of several basic machine learning regression models using the Scikit-Learn library. Each section of the Jupyter notebook is dedicated to a different regression model, exploring how each can be applied to predict continuous outcomes effectively.

## Models Included
- **Linear Regression**: A standard regression model used for benchmarking.
- **Logistic Regression**: Employed for modeling the probability of a discrete attribute.
- **Decision Trees**: Used for creating a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features.
- **SVC (Support Vector Classifier)**: Applied for classification tasks by finding the hyperplane that best divides a dataset into classes.
- **Random Forest Regression**: An ensemble method that uses multiple decision trees to improve regression outcomes.

These models were tested by adapting the relevant lines from Scikit-Learn to each specific model's requirements.
## Prerequisites
